# pseudostore
This is a pseudostore that acts as a bridge between a redbubble store and the most liked products by the customers.
React is used for frontend.
This project is setup from scratch and create-react-app is not used as this a fairly simple project.
Firebase boilerplate integration is done that makes the website scalable if it attracts desired user attraction to implement auth and wishlist type functionality.
CSS animation is used in the header and product cards to make it attractive to the user.
All the css is written from scratch and no library like bootstrap is used.
Font awesome icons are included but not used much.

THis is a fairly simple app but can used as a beginner level tutorial for learning fullstack react with firebase.
